# Bicarakan.id Front End Web Test Project:

Create a web project of a very simple to-do list app.

Your web app needs to fulfill these requirements:
- Create to-do items
- List all to-do items
- Update to-do items
- Delete to-do items
- Arrange to-do items based on the order requested by the user (like Trello).

You can explore your own design and feel free to use any free template for the actual web design.

You need to use tech stack below for this project:
- Vue JS or React JS (Nuxt JS or Next JS preferred)
- Typescript
- E2E tests (Optional)

The objective of this project is to assess your capability to work with technologies we use in our day-to-day job at Bicarakan.id. We highly valued things like code organization, design sense, and testing capabilities so keep that in mind.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask us at angga@bicarakan.id.

Good luck!
